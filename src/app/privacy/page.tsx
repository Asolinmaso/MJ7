            <p className="mb-4">
              Having said that, a privacy policy is a statement that discloses some or all of the ways a 
              website collects, uses, discloses, processes, and manages the data of its visitors and 
              customers. It usually also includes a statement regarding the website’s commitment to 
              protecting its visitors’ or customers’ privacy, and an explanation about the different 
              mechanisms the website is implementing in order to protect privacy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Different jurisdictions have different legal obligations of what must be included in a 
              Privacy Policy. You are responsible to make sure you are following the relevant legislation 
              to your activities and location.

            <p>
              Generally speaking, a Privacy Policy often addresses these types of issues: the types of 
              information the website is collecting and the manner in which it collects the data; an 
              explanation about why is the website collecting these types of information; what are the 
              website’s practices on sharing the information with third parties; ways in which your 
              visitors and customers can exercise their rights according to the relevant privacy 
              legislation; the specific practices regarding minors’ data collection; and much, much more.
